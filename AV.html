                <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Problem</h5>
                <p>
                   
                    Access to public transportation is a key need for people. However, individuals with disabilities often face challenges in transportation,
                    particularly those with severe cognitive impairments. 
                    Currently, there is no guarantee that autonomous vehicles will be accessible to the broader disability community when they are deployed
                </p>
                        <h5>Goal</h5>
                        <p>
                        The project aims to adopt an inclusive design approach and accessibility guidline to improve the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) shuttle bus with a focus on commuters and bus riders who have cognitive impairment. 
                        </p>

                     <h5>Research question</h5>
                        <p>
                        What challenges and opportunities do AI and sensors bring for passengers in an Autonomous Vehicle service when there is no bus driver?
                        </p>

                     <h5>Challenges</h5>
                        <p>
                        Under the covid restriction, we cannot study an interaction between the Autonomous Vehicle shuttle bus and passenger who has cognitive impairments. We can only rely on points of view from experts.
                         More than 20 interview invitations have been sent out to experts(e.g caregiver) or organizations which work with people with cognitive disabilities. However, only 3 experts replied back. 
                        </p>

                <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Process</h4>
                <p>
                    This thesis project follows the Double Diamond process. In this framework, the design process is divided into four distinct phases: Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver, which maps the divergent and convergent stages of the design process.

                            <p>
                                User research was conducted to understand functions of the current AV bus service, responsibilities of the AV and normal bus driver,
                                and users' difficulties and challenges during a journey.
                            </p> 

                            <h6> Interview with bus drivers and general passengers</h6>  
                            <p>
                                We came to understand that the bus can monitor the situations and provide appropriate operation itself. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Interviewing a bus driver, we found out which function could be replace by AI in the future. 
                                We also interviewed general passengers for their experience on the AV bus to support a diversity perspective. 
                            </p>

                            <h6> Interview with experts</h6> 
                                <p>
                                    Due to the epidemic restiction, we didn't have a chance to interview people with cognitive disabilities in a real context.
                                    We researched literatures related to cognitive impairment and interviewed experts to understand the target usersâ behavior and difficulties when commuting with public transportation.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Surveys with questionaires were sent out to understand the interaction and conversation between target user and a bus driver. For example,what kind of information do you ask a bus driver? Why do you need a bus driver?

                                To test the first design approach of navigation footprint and navigation signage, a test was conducted at the bus platform RegnbÃ¥gsgatan in Gothenburg. 
                                Four participants were recruited in the test. From the user research in the previous phase, most users found that the AV bus station was hard to spot, 
                                thus in this test participants were given the task to the AV bus platform from the normal bus platform. 
                                This test also aimed to simulate the real scenario that users transiting bus between bus platforms.

                            Users pointed out that they only needed to follow the footprint which they know that they will not lose the way to the bus platform.

                            The script can be synced to mobile phones or taken the photo in case people forget the route. 
                            During transit process, it is essential to provide the route information both online and offline to fulfill the requirement of passengers with different navigation behavior.

                                    The announcement in audible and visual form is the basic requirement of public transportation. 
                                    Hence, both audible and visual announcements of the bus stops are required. 
                                    From the surveys, research and testing, users stated that if there is a clear announcement and information on the bus it is enough for their journey.

                               We found that the calm and humane announcement can reduce stress and assist them to perform the right actions

                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Learn & Insights</h3>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we experienced many unexpected events and obstacles at the beginning of the project.
                    We have learnt valuable lessons from this project and these are what I learnt and reflected.

                            <p>
                                We found out that even though the target user have a same disorder but they can have a different syntoms.
                                Thus, we need to be very specific in choosing the user characteristic. Try to narrow it down as much as posssible.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                We had difficulties conducting real-life testing with people with congnitive disabilities or contacting experts.
                                The test data and outcome could be different from the current on.
                                More time should be spent on adapting the framework to specifically fit the target group.

                            <p>
                                When adopting an AI to create a UX, we need to consider many perspective and limitation. 
                                In this project, we only touch the surface of Human AI interaction.
                                This project can be investigate further in the future

                                During this thesis, we receive many feedback related the trust and safety. Some users trust an AI, some not. 
                                This issues can be investigate in term of funtionally or culture.
