                The first plan in this project is to understand are there any usability issues on the website, which areas and how critical it is.
                Before creating the test script, I experienced the website to understand the overall process.
                And the usability testing was chosen to examine the usability problems.

                            After the first hand-on experience, the question and tasks were formulated to test on users to discover the problem on the website.
                            The session was conducted on ZOOM and 7 participants were asked to perform the task and think aloud

                        The problems were categorized based on the level of value and effort of this project’s scope.
                        Some problems were placed in the low value because they are out of scope.
                        This helped me prioritize what I need to focus on in each iteration and prototype

                            From the feedback, I started to research how space and museum websites organized their content and layout.
                            The interesting mechanism and suitable layouts were chosen and put in on the sketch. It showed that this presentation matches with the info and goal of the trek website or not.
                            Also, I wanted to utilize the old design as much as possible because it is time efficiency for the UI developers team.

                            After the sketch, the low-fi prototype was created to determine which chosen methods/design capable to improve the efficiency of the website or not.
                            In this stage, the attributes that were improved and tested are The layout of the website, the visualization that translated from the current info, the navigation and The new exploring navigation.
                            For example, the layout of qualitative and quantitative information was reorganized to a Z-shaped pattern to make it easier to read.

                            After the testing, the participants still do not understand the concept of the website instantly.
                            They always skip the website explanation during the task. The carousel method is the fit method to look at the previous content,
                            Some of the mechanism for this design does not match with the users’ mental model. The bread crumb is the right choice to show where users are during the session.
                            Visualizing the instruction of the VR transition from text to graphic and the Z-shaped pattern for reading format are the right solution for the user to follow it.

                            During this process, two iterations of the hi-fi prototype were conducted.
                            In the first iteration, the different navigation, layouts, presentation, fonts, component and color themes were experimented with to find the fit solution.
                            For instance, The current navigation of exploring from the chosen trek portal to the trek portal detail was improved to make a user go to the endpoint faster.
                            For the look and feel, I aim to make a user feel that they are in the universe when exploring the website.

                            The second iteration mainly worked on refinding the information to show what they can expect from the website, each section and sub-section.
                            For instance, put a short description under each sub-section, showed a sub-section beforehand, visualized a long website's description to a three graphic.

                                        The second usability were conducted for the low-fi prototype with 3 target user via ZOOM.
                                        In the usability test, users were assigned the same tasks as a first usability testing to validate an improvement which are about instructions, info layout and navigation.
                                        During the session, the participant was asked to think aloud while executing the given tasks.

                                        Two round of usability testing were conducted for hi-fi prototype with 4 participants and UI developers from JPL.
                                        The tasks is similar with a previouse one but include the question about look and feel of the website to validate the theme color.
                                        More content were put to create a similar environment as the existing website, in order to validate a layout and copy writing.
                                        The tasks were given and participants have to complete them while thinking aloud; after each task, participants were asked to rate the difficulty and satifaction rate from 1 to 5,
                                        and after the testing, some general questions were brought up to discuss more about the user though of the prototype in detail.

                            After three month and many iteration, this is a final desgin. This design shows how the information can be presented to users in many differnets way.
                            How the graphic can capture the users attention and deliver a message more than a text. and how the improved navigation can increase website's efficiency.

                            As the team does not have a design system. They might face a UI consistency problem in the
                            future. The design system is a design guidline of the project. It has many benefits when it comes to expand the product or use as a guideline for a development.
                            The system is composed of tangibles and non-tangibles elements such as tools for designers & developers, patterns, components, guidelines, etc.

                            The user research and usability testing are the importance stage of digital product developement.
                            The webiste design might go to the wrong direction. To answer the user experience assumtion from the develpment team, the website should be tested with target users.
                            Foe this website, I found the main works that can improve the usability and working process in the UI team can be seen below.
                        </p>


                        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">User research</h5>
                        <p>
                            The website is designed for three different types of users. It is very challenging to design for all in one website because there are different needs for each target.
                            This project is only focused on one target of a user from three main target groups. Also, there are many categories of the target user.
                            In order to design a website that fulfills the user expectation, the team needs to conduct more user researching.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Mobile version</h5>
                        <p>
                            The website aims to support the desktop and mobile version.
                            However, this project did not focus on improving a mobile version and chose to only improve the desktop one because this vision was informed in the middle of the development.
                            For the future work this project should focus on a mobile-first design to create a design that suits both platforms.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Copy writing</h5>
                        <p>
                            One of the issues during the usability testing is a copywriting of the website.
                            The content needs to be writen in an interesting way and easier for the reader to understand and follow.
